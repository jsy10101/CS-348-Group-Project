# CS-348-Group-Project

### Overview

This application aims simulate a bank. I will provide a comprehensive summary of a user’s finances, include summaries of the balance in each of their accounts, the total aggregated balance over all of a user’s accounts, the amount spent by a user over a given period, and filters for transactions with more features soon to be added!

### Running the application:

- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

- Install NodeJS v18.10.0 (installation instructions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).

- Install the yarn package manager (installation instructions can be found [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable])).

- Install PostgreSQL on the platform you are using for testing. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)).

- Make sure you can use the psql command in your shell.

- Run the following commands in your shell
  ```sudo -i -u postgres```
  ```psql```
  ```ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<password>';```

- Following this, log out as the postgres user.

- Run
```createdb <database> -U postgres```

- Navigate to the .env file and replace the DEV_DATABASE_URL provided with `postgres://postgres:<password>@127.0.0.1:5432/<database>`

- Please note: the above steps from postgres installation onwards are a stop-gap solution, and will be more streamlined before the next milestone. 

- Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following commands:
`yarn install`
`yarn start`


### Creating and Loading the Database for Testing purposes:

#### Running queries and testing locally with psql

 - Install PostgreSQL on the platform you are using for testing. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

 - Make sure you can run the `psql` command on your shell.

 - Run the folloing commands in the queries/creation directory:
  ```psql < createDB.sql``` 
  ```psql < populateUsers.sql```
  ```psql < populateAccounts.sql```
  ```psql < populateTransactions.sql```

 - Test the SQL queries found in the queries folder with `psql` and compare with the expected output files under queries/expectedOut.

 - To remove all tables, from the queries folder, run:
 ```psql < creation/dropDB.sql```
